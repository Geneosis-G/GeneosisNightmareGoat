[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod]A lot of mods requests have been made to be able to use fire in a lot of different ways, in the beginning I was not really interested as some mods already exist to spread fire, but after someone asked for a goat using the Lava Horse from the MMO map, I thought that it could be a nice idea to give him all the fire abilities I could think about :)
So first of all, I had to find a way to use the Lava Horse model on a playable goat... Thanks to the Jousting Goat mutator there was already some animations and physical body usable for the horse, so I could reuse them with the skin of the Lava Horse ^^ The only bad point is that those models don't have any attack or lick animation, which means you can't use them in the game.
The first ability I added was the flame trail: this is a group of invisible burning object that appear when the goat move, and dissapear after a few seconds. Everything touching those flames will catch on fire the same way they do when touching a grill or another burning creature.
Then I added the Burning Baaa ability, which is basically using the same burning effect but apply it to every creature in a certain radius around the goat.
For the explosive jump, I wanted something that will blow up everything near you when you jump but without touching the goat itself. To achieve that I had to make a custom explosion function that will ignore the goat, this way I can give it a custom jump impulsion with always the same power.
Finally I added the Explosive Landing when the goat touch the ground with enough vertical speed. It works almost the same way as the Meteor of the Wizard Goat: the faster you fall, the bigger the explosion will be.
